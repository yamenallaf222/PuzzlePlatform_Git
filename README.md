Hey , this game is a learning project that encompasses a Menu System as plugin which means it does use interfaces to 
avoid dependencies and making the menu system transferable to other projects , the game is about two players being able to join session that are created by one of them and then the other can
join either via steam subsystem or NULL online subsystem that is the default one by unreal engine

the game will start (moving all joined players to the playing level).



afterwards the players will be in a level that has some moving platforms as puzzles
